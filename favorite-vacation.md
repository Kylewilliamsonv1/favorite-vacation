# Barbados 
Barbados is my favorite vacation to take my family on!  It has lots to do that include parasailing, cave dives, pink sandy beaches, and epic seafood usually caught fresh that day!
## Activities
- The _Pink sandy_ beaches in barados come from a specific seashell within the region that you will not find anywhere else on earth.  Its rough in texture and is relatively _**"new"**_ in terms of sand compared to what you might find on the coast of oregon. ![pink sandy beach](img/barbadosbeach.jpeg "pink sandy beach")
